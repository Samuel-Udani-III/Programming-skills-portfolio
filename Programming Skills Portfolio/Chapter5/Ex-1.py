"""

person = {
    'first_name': 'Zetsu',
    'last_name': 'Mishimune',
    'age': 17,
    'city': 'Dubai',
    }

print(person['first_name'])
print(person['last_name'])
print(person['age'])
print(person['city'])

#Alright, for that code, person is a dictionary with several "key,value" pairs. In this case, 
#person's name is "Zetsu Mishimune," person's age is 17, and their city is "Dubai." The code will print the 
#first and last names, as well as the person's age and city. It's just that simple, and you can use it as a reference 
#to keep all information of a person in one place!
