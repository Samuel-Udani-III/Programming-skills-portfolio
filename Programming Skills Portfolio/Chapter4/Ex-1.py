Chapter 4
Exercise 1
Imagine an alien was just shot down in a game. Create a variable called alien_color and assign it a value of 'green', 'yellow', or 'red'.

•Write an if statement to test whether the alien’s color is green. If it is, print a message that the player just earned 5 points.

•Write one version of this program that passes the if test and another that fails. (The version that fails will have no output.)
"""
#I assign a variable to the color green and use the if command to tell if the alien color is green
alien_color = 'green'

if alien_color == 'green':
    print("Congratulations! You just earned 5 points.")
#if the color isn't green it won't show the output
