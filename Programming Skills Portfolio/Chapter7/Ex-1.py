Chapter 7
Exercise 1
Write a function called display_message() that prints one sentence telling everyone what you are learning about in this chapter. Call the

function, and make sure the message displays correctly.
"""
def display_message():
    """Display a message about what I'm learning."""
    msg = "I'm learning to do loops in python."
    print(msg)

display_message()

#Well, this code is a function called "display\_message" with no parameters. 
#Within this function is a hard-coded string of text: "I'm learning to do loops in python."

#This function does very little, as it only displays that statement to the console, 
#and the function name is not really being referenced anywhere else. You just write "display\_message()" 
#anywhere else to display the text. In this case, you can even type "display\_message()" into the console to see the message yourself!
