Exercise 3
Write a loop that never ends, and run it. (To end the loop, press ctrl-C or close the window displaying the output.)
"""

while True:
    print("looping...")
#This code is a very simple loop, consisting simply of a "while True" format, which will always be true, and then a print function... and that's about it, really! Since this code is running in a python interpreter, you can see the "looing..." text in the console, and the loop will never end unless you terminate the interpreter with Ctrl+C or by closing the console window entirely.
